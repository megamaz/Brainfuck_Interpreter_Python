# This is how brainfuck works:
# You have to visualize as if it was just one long row of cells. (30,000 cells) which all start at 0. Each can go up to 255.
# There is a pointer which points at one of the cells. This is the cell that will be edited. To edit the cell, you use the syntaxes.
# Brainfuck only has 8 syntax:
# <     Move the tick one cell to the left
# >     Move the tick one cell to the right
# .     Display the current ASCII value of the cell (E.X; ASCII value 65 = A)
# ,     Accept one character as input and save it's ASCII value (E.X; input B, it will be saved as 66)
# [     Mark the start of a loop. The loop will be ignored if the current value is 0.
# ]     Marks the end of a loop. The loop will be exited if the current cell is 0.
# +     Adds 1 to the current cell.
# -     Removes 1 to the current cell.
# And that's about it. Everything else in brainfuck will be read as comments (or just completely ignored.)

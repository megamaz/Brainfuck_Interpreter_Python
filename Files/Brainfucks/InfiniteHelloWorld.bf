[-][


A value clearer, which relies on the first cell to be set to 255 is this:
+[[-]<+]


Here's how it works;

To ensure that this always opens, the plus is added at the beginning.
The [-] Removes the current value from the cell, setting it to 0. Since it's cleared, we can exit the loop and move back.
To be completely sure that no spaces of random 0s stop our loop, we add a plus before ending it. it doesn't matter since the
current cell is going to be completely cleared anyways.


Side note: if you would like to make the code end and have all the cells be cleared, (not sure why), then add another + at the end, resetting the first cell to 0.


Here is the code minimized:
+[-->>(++++++++++++++[>+++++<-]>++.--<++++++[>+++++<-]>+.+++++++..+++.>++++++[>+++++<-]>++.--<+++++++++++[>+++++<-]>++.<<.+++.------.--------.>>> +++++[>++++++<-]>+++.)+[[-]<+]++++++++++.----------+]
